				<h3>june the 19th, 2018</h3>
				<span class=firstline>These days, everything is: difficult to define. Pockets of</span> pseudo-marital bliss punctuate the stormy weather. I turn 29 tomorrow.<br><br>
-x-<br><br>

<span class=firstline>These days, everything is: constantly changing. Growth is on the</span> horizon, personal and otherwise. The year is halfway over & it&#39;s been eventful, surely, and tumultuous on occasion, but mostly it&#39;s been nurturing. I&#39;ve moved into a new apartment & two bundles of sweet dried flowers decorate my workspace. I&#39;m writing, presently, and I&#39;ve been reading, presently. <br><br>

A new friend, who owns a bookstore, sold me an entire (used) 1923 Yale Library collection of Shakespeare (40 books) for $10. I&#39;m enthused. I finished reading King Henry The Sixth (Part Two) yesterday and Julius Caesar the month prior. <br><br>

I have ambitions to be more forthcoming about my daily writing: I intend to share it, here, on my blog, with the world, every day, if only to make myself accountable for something. <br><br>

Already I&#39;m dreading words like &#39;mundane&#39; and &#39;quotidian.&#39;<br><br>

-x-<br><br>

<span class=firstline>I&#39;m failing to find the balance between interpersonal and</span> private/professional. What I mean is: sometimes, I live as if I exist in a vacuum. I&#39;m able to withdraw into myself so completely, at times, that I no longer see or hear the person next to me. Sometimes, it&#39;s important for me to spend time shrouded in my bubble so that I&#39;m able to focus on the words at hand.<br><br> 

About those sweet dried flowers &#8212; mauve blush roses mixed with golden-white ones, deep blue asters accented among them &#8212; they were a gift for B&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, my love. The perks of a shared apartment include living with the gifts we buy for one another. <br><br>

I feel as though I&#39;ve been 29 for years. In fact, I&#39;m only 28, but sometime after 24 everything started to blur together. Time moves so fast, anymore, that I&#39;m amazed every time I glimpse the calendar. If I don&#39;t act now: when will I?<br><br>
